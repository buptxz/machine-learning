    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "- Random Forest<br>\n",
    "It's used for classification and regression. It's an ensemble of decision trees. The real-world application include spam email classification, news category classification, etc.<br>\n",
    "Strengths: It can reduce variance in comparison to regular decision trees.<br>\n",
    "Weaknesses: Not as easy to visually interpret.<br>\n",
    "I think decision tree is a good candidate for this problem. This is a binary classification problem. The number of \n",
    "features is 103 which is not too many for decision trees. Random forest is a bagging method of decision trees. It can model non-linear relations for this problem with little user effort and is also pretty fast & scalable. \n",
    "- AdaBoost<br>\n",
    "It's an ensemble learning model. It can be used for classification and regression. It can be used in conjunction with many other types of learning algorithms to improve performance. The real-world application include spam email classification, news category classification, etc.<br>\n",
    "Strengths: Does feature selection resulting in relatively simple classifier<br>\n",
    "Weaknesses: Sensitive to noisy data and outliers<br>\n",
    "AdaBoost can be used with many different classifiers, can improve classification accuracy and not prone to overfitting. As I mentioned before, I think decision tree is a reasonable model for this problem. I am thinking of using Decision Tree as the base algorithm for AdaBoost. Adaboost use boosting instead of bagging in Random Forest. Unlike bagging, in boosting the subset creation is not random and depends upon the performance of the previous models. \n",
    "- Support Vector Machines (SVM)<br>\n",
    "SVM is a supervised learning model with associated learning algorithms that analyze data used for classification and regression analysis. The real-world application include face detection, image classification and hand writing recognition.<br>\n",
    "Strengths: Performs similarly to logistic regression when linear separation. Handle high dimensional data well<br>\n",
    "Weaknesses: Susceptible to overfitting/training issues depending on kernel<br>\n",
    "An SVM training algorithm builds a model that assigns new examples to one category or the other, making it a non-probabilistic binary linear classifier. SVM is a linear classifier because its decision boundary for classification is linear. But for this problem we can turn SVM into a non-linear classifier by employing the concept of kernel, at the expense of heavier computational resources required. The kernel trick will help to find non-linear relations in the CharityML data."

    "AdaBoost is a ensemble machine learning algorithm, short for Adaptive Boosting. It can be used in conjunction with many other types of learning algorithms to improve performance. When we have weaker learners, we will use boosting to make the learners stronger and stronger.\n",
    "\n",
    "The base learning algorithm we use for CharityML is DecisionTreeClassifier. Decision tree is a tree to go from observations about the person to conclusions about his/her income. For example, when we know this person's highest degree is PhD and his/her job is software engieering, we will make the decision that his/her income is over 50K. But if his/her highest degree is high school, we will make the opposite dicision even without knowing his/her job. With all these rules, we are behaving like go down from a tree's root. Yes, the tree's root is on the top and leafs are on the bottom. Whenever we get to a leaf, we are able to make the decision. \n",
    "\n",
    "The training process is a iterative process. We will take a look of all the samples we have and improve our prediction model. At the very first beginning, we have weak decision tree learners that might be just sligtly better than a random guess. But that doesn't matter. For example, if the model finds that most of the people that have capital loss that is more than 10,000 will have >50K income. The model will learn that the capital loss 10,000 might be a good number to make the decision. After a weak learner is added, the data are reweighted according to the accuracy of the learner: for the next iteration, the samples we just misclassified become more important. For example, we will count one sample as two if we misclassify them again. Thus, future weak learners focus more on the examples that previous weak learners misclassified. The individual learners can be weak, but as long as the performance of each one is slightly better than random guessing, the final model can be proven to be a strong learner.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have already seen the information of a lot of people. We will have the ability to predict the income of a new person. We make our decision based on the decision tree we just made. Go down the tree based on the person's information and we will have a result when we go the way down to the leaf."

    "- Initialize the classifier you've chosen and store it in `clf`.\n",
    " - Set a `random_state` if one is available to the same state you set before.\n",
    "- Create a dictionary of parameters you wish to tune for the chosen model.\n",
    " - Example: `parameters = {'parameter' : [list of values]}`.\n",
    " - **Note:** Avoid tuning the `max_features` parameter of your learner if that parameter is available!\n",
    "- Use `make_scorer` to create an `fbeta_score` scoring object (with $\\beta = 0.5$).\n",
    "- Perform grid search on the classifier `clf` using the `'scorer'`, and store it in `grid_obj`.\n",
    "- Fit the grid search object to the training data (`X_train`, `y_train`), and store it in `grid_fit`.\n",

In the case of this project, that means we wish to identify a small number of features that most strongly predict whether an individual makes at most or more than \\$50,000.\n",

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "The five features generated by the learning algorithms are capital-loss, age, capital gain, hour-per-week and education-num. Compared with my discussion in Question 6, all of these features are included in my previous discussion. The difference is the order of them. The capital loss, age and capital gain are more important than I thought. The only feature I mentioned but is not here is the occupation. The visualization here tells us that capital loss and gain are strong indicators of higher income. As I just discussed, higher income people will make investments more often. "

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
